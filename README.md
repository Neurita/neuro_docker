- AFNI
- VTK
- ITK and SimpleITK (the code for this is commented for now)
- DCM2NIIX

### Base Docker Image

* [ubuntu:16.04](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/ubuntu/)


### Installation

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

2. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Neurita/neuro_docker.git

    cd neuro_docker
    ```

3. Build the docker image.

    ```bash
    docker build -t="dockerfile/neuro" .
    ```


### Usage

After a successful installation, you can run the docker container and run your analysis.

```bash
docker run -it dockerfile/neuro
```

### Data sharing

If you want to share with the container a folder path with data, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -v <host_path>:<guest_path> dockerfile/neuro
```

For example, if you have some data in `/media/data/brains` and you would like it to be accessible in the container in `/data`. You should run:

```bash
docker run -it -v /media/data/brains:/data dockerfile/neuro
```

### Notes

Remember to add the `--rm` flag to the `docker run` command if you don't want to store a new container after exiting it. This will save you disk space.

Have a better understanding of the `docker run` command by running:

```bash
docker run --help
```
